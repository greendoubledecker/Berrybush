# Berrybush
A bush with berries on it. It can sometimes get too tall though. Run it a few times if you only see a stem.

The berries are red circles and the stems and leaves are green lines. If you have enough patience, it will grow to the top of the canvas.

The algorithm : The variable called *rand* is a radom value between 0 and 1000 (why did I choose 1000 instead of 1?!?) If *rand* is less than 50, then a berry will appear. If *rand* is between 50 and 100, the stem will split into three. If *rand* is between 100 and 200, the stem will split into two. If *rand* is is between 200 and 900, the stem will grow upwards. If *rand* is greater than 900, then the stem will stop growing.
